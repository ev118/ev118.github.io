      a story about games from the world of Polytopia <br />
      24 October 2025
    </h2>

    <p class="story noindent">
      In every village in every corner of Zeboya, from the mountains in the east to the semi-desert in the north to the fertile
      savannah in the south, there can be found a game called Moloza. Everywhere it looks slightly different, but it always has
      a board, etched into the ground, composed of circles connected by lines and stones, of two different colors for the two
      players, that move from circle to circle along the lines. It is a game of pure strategy: the only forces that determine
      the outcome are the players&rsquo; minds, and a sufficiently apt player could learn how to always win&mdash;though the
      children and farmers who take leisure in this game would never think to devote enough time to it to reach that level.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      I was introduced to Moloza not as a recreational activity, as it is for most of our population, but as an object of study.
      When I was at the university, I studied the theory of individuals and societies, what the more travelled scholars call
      &ldquo;anthropology.&rdquo; But at the same time, some mathematicians made a ground-breaking discovery that would soon be
      known throughout the city and spark the study of games as an academic field.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      What these researchers had found was a method for analyzing games of strategy such as the many variants of Moloza that,
      given enough time, could work out the optimal strategy so as to never lose (assuming such a strategy exists). Its
      resemblance to the work of the Anzala is telling of the nature of this discovery. They assembled an array of jars, each
      one corresponding to a possible position of the game, and in each jar put several beads of various colors, each one
      corresponding to a possible move that could be made from that position. The researchers then used this as a machine that
      could play against a Polytopian player: from a given position it encountered, it would make a random move, and whether it
      won or lost the game would determine whether it was trained to make that move again in the future or to avoid it. After
      many rounds of this, the beads corresponding to losing moves had been eliminated, and the machine was consistently able to
      beat even the best among the researchers&mdash;they had found the perfect strategy.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      The announcement of this concept set off an academic explosion in the city. From the one version of Moloza that they had
      initially worked on, these mathematicians and their colleagues soon constructed machines to beat many different variants
      of the game, and scholars throughout the university studied these and other games with this new tool for
      &ldquo;solving&rdquo; them both simply to show that it could be done and to look for extensions in other disciplines. Over
      time, one problem came to loom over the new field of game theory: could a game be constructed that, despite conforming to
      the same basic structure as Moloza, could not be beaten with the jar-and-bead method? Some believed that it was
      impossible, and set about trying to prove it. The majority, though, thought it was possible, and everyone from
      mathematicians to sculptors to businessmen quickly found themselves in a meta-game of simbaza and geroffy: as they worked
      to design increasingly complex games of strategy, the university researchers kept outdoing them with increasingly complex
      sets of jars and beads; no end was in sight.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      This is where I entered the fray. I did not study with the scholars most devoted to games at the university, but even with
      some separation I could not avoid the developments occurring at a break-neck speed all around me. Instead, I looked for
      connections to my own work. As I studied the politics of tribes and their relationships with each other, I saw the first
      hint of a solution to the problem. All the Square, with its thousands of tiles, its hundreds of cities and villages with
      hundreds of thousands of Polytopians, was the board of an immense strategy game on which twelve players (twelve who were
      playing by the rules, anyhow) were each looking for the fastest route to victory. If even a fraction of this complexity
      could be harnessed in a game in the style of Moloza, it would surely overpower the jars and beads that had been able to
      handle everything thrown at them so far.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      And so I worked. Once I got out of university, of course, I had “real” work, the kind that put food on the
      table&mdash;mostly advising the city&rsquo;s leaders on how to plan for the future against a shifting external background,
      ideally without starting any riots in the streets. But when I had time apart from that, I designed, iterated, built and
      destroyed, wrote and drew and sculpted, all in the hopes of finding a game that could capture the complexity of the entire
      Square in a space no bigger than the table I was standing at. I found that the best balance of strategy and intricacy was
      found in the wars between tribes. Just two tribes with relatively small but diverse armies have a staggering number of
      arrangements when given sufficient space to move and maneuver, seeking to capture the enemy&rsquo;s capital.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      But I knew that the jar-and-bead method could defeat this: it was obvious that the best strategy was simply to move
      towards the opposing capital, so it would not take long for the machine to plot this general course and then refine the
      individual movements. I had to keep hunting, keep developing, because even as I felt like I was going nowhere I somehow
      knew that I was only a small leap of insight away from the game that could beat the machine.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      That epiphany came when my work in politics led me back to my university studies. I had taken a particular interest in the
      society of the Y&abreve;dakk. Not only were they primarily nomadic traders&mdash;I did not need university to teach me
      that&mdash;but the wealthy among them would often carry supplies with them to set up what amounted to small villages
      everywhere they went, which could be used as spontaneous trade centers or, in the case of the political leaders, makeshift
      courts in the plains between cities. With my game always in the back of my mind, I realized: what if the two armies were
      more like the Y&abreve;dakk, with the political center&mdash;what I had been thinking of as the capital, a static
      city&mdash;constantly in motion and even acting as a part of the army in its own right?
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      This, it turned out, completely remade the game. Now the game could not progress with such an obvious direction, and more
      defensive strategies opened up to make use of the new mechanic. The test games I played against my colleagues felt less
      like variations on a stale theme and more like unique journeys to novel destinations. I was ready to announce my contender
      for the game that could not be solved with jars and beads.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      Despite my excitement, my idea was largely ignored. So many games had, in the turns since the first jar-and-bead
      experiment, been proposed, tested, and defeated that no one expected anything new. But all it took was a couple scholars
      who were now well versed in game theory recognizing that my game had a newfound potential, and they set about constructing
      the array of jars they would need. Before I even got the chance to play one game against the machine, other scholars
      noticed the project and started questioning whether they had accounted for all the possible positions, and the debate over
      this game reached such heights that the university had no choice but to shut it down. The scholars accepted that I had
      finally found the game that outdid the machine.
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      This announcement garnered more attention, and word spread quickly that the biggest open problem at the university was now
      solved. Enthusiasts of Cazimbo throughout the city wanted to get their hands on my game, seeking to establish dominance
      without any challenger of clay and glass, and for a brief period I was more interesting to the city&rsquo;s leaders than
      even the top experts on farming or trade. All were intrigued that someone like me, with whom many of them had worked at
      one time or another, had managed to steal the spotlight of the entire university with something as simple as a game; they
      wanted to learn its secrets straight from the source, though I knew none of them could ever be much good at it. None, that
      is, except the ambassador from Luxidoor&hellip;
    </p>
    <p class="story">
      I found myself in a small yet ornate building near the center of the city, in a room with just one table. Opposite the
      entrance was the ambassador with their posse of advisors and guards, all curious as to what had sparked such a rustle
      among the local leaders. I marked out the board on the table, laid out the pieces my friend had sculpted for me, and
      started explaining the rules. The ambassador&rsquo;s face went from impassive to surprised, but when I finished explaining
      I looked up to see them disappointed, at a loss for words. They managed to stammer out just one sentence in response:
