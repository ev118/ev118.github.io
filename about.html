    <p class="about">
      The front page of this website is what my bio on social platforms would look like if not for character limits. Everything
      else is work I&rsquo;ve done that I decided should see the light of day. There&rsquo;s nothing special here in terms of
      code or design&mdash;use it as you like as a resource; I&rsquo;ve been learning as I continue to add to it&mdash;but
      <span style="color: #f81030">please give me credit for anything that is the product of my significant effort.</span>
