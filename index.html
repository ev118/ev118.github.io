            <p>Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.</p>
            <p>We are not figuratively, but literally, stardust.</p>
            <p>Not all those who wander are lost.</p>
            <p>
                The meek [that is, those who carry a sword but do not use it]
                will inherit the world.

            <p>
                To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you
                something else is the greatest accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life is a maze, and love is a riddle; life's a game made for
                everyone, and love is the prize.
            </p>
            <p>Forgiveness is the gift one gives oneself.</p>
            <p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</p>
            <p>
                When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched
                to everything else in the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it
                never will.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opposite of love is not hate, but indifference; the opposite
                of feeling can only be the absence of feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not your duty to complete the work, but neither are you
                free to desist from it.
            </p>
            <p>In a world where change is the only constant, embrace it.</p>
            <p>If life is soup, I am a fork.</p>
