        Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. &bull; Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it
        never will. &bull; The meek&mdash;that is, those who carry a sword but do not use it&mdash;will inherit the world.

        <span style="color: #4098e0"> It is not your duty to complete the work, but nor are you free to desist from it. </span>

        The opposite of love is not hate but indifference; the opposite of feeling can only be the absence of feeling. &bull;
        <span style="color: #f81030">Imitation is the highest form of flattery.</span> &bull; One of the greatest gifts you can
        give yourself is to forgive. &bull; Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.

        Life is a maze, and love is a riddle; life&rsquo;s a game made for everyone, and love is the prize. &bull; Darkness
        cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. &bull; In a world
        where change is the only constant, embrace it. This, too, shall pass.

          When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.

        &bull; We are not figuratively, but literally, stardust. &bull; Not all those who wander are lost.

          To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
        </span>
        &bull; Everybody is a genius. But, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life
        believing that it is stupid. &bull; If life is soup, I am a fork.
