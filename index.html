                Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. &emsp;⯀&emsp; We
                are not figuratively, but literally, stardust. &emsp;⯀&emsp; Not
                all those who wander are lost. &emsp;⯀&emsp; The meek [that is,
                those who carry a sword but do not use it] will inherit the
                world. &emsp;⯀&emsp; To be yourself in a world that is
                constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest
                accomplishment. &emsp;⯀&emsp; Life is a maze, and love is a
                riddle; life's a game made for everyone, and love is the prize.
                &emsp;⯀&emsp; Forgiveness is the gift one gives oneself.
                &emsp;⯀&emsp; Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
                &emsp;⯀&emsp; When we try to pick out anything by itself, we
                find it hitched to everything else in the universe.
                &emsp;⯀&emsp; Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never
                has and it never will. &emsp;⯀&emsp; The opposite of love is not
                hate, but indifference; the opposite of feeling can only be the
                absence of feeling. &emsp;⯀&emsp; It is not your duty to
                complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it.
                &emsp;⯀&emsp; In a world where change is the only constant,
                embrace it. &emsp;⯀&emsp; If life is soup, I am a fork.
