  <h1>Hello! The name&rsquo;s <span style="color:#e08700;">Elijah</span> <span class="pronouns">(he/they)</span>.</h1>
  <div class="quotes">
    <p class="q-left">Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. &bull; Power concedes nothing without a demand. It
      never has and it never will. &bull; The meek&mdash;that is, those who carry a sword but do not use it&mdash;will
      inherit the world. &bull; <span style="color: #4098e0">It is not your duty to complete the work, but nor are you
        free to desist from it.</span><br /></p>
    <p class="q-right">The opposite of love is not hate but indifference; the opposite of feeling can only be the
      absence of feeling. &bull; <span style="color: #f81030">Imitation is the highest form of flattery.</span> &bull;
      One of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is to forgive. &bull; Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your
      balance, you must keep moving.<br /></p>
    <p class="q-left">Life is a maze, and love is a riddle; life&rsquo;s a game made for everyone, and love is the
      prize. &bull; Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love
      can do that. &bull; In a world where change is the only constant, embrace it. This, too, shall pass.<br /></p>
    <p class="q-right"><span style="color: #40ff00">When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to
        everything else in the universe.</span> &bull; We are not figuratively, but literally, stardust. &bull; Not all
      those who wander are lost.<br /></p>
    <p class="q-left"><span style="color: #e08700">To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you
        something else is the greatest accomplishment.</span> &bull; Everybody is a genius. But, if you judge a fish by
      its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. &bull; If life is soup, I am
      a fork.</p>
