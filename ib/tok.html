    To what extent do you agree with the claim &ldquo;all models are wrong, but some are useful&rdquo; (attributed to
    George Box)?
  </h1>
  <h3>IB Theory of Knowledge <br> 6 March 2025</h3>

  <p class="noindent">
    In my DP Chemistry studies, we have discussed energetics, the theory that describes the relationship between energy
    and chemical changes. The common trend among concepts in this topic is taking a complex process and simplifying it
    to a number. The tables of these numbers in the data booklet, therefore, are models of the theory of energetics.
    This is a common pattern in the natural sciences, mathematics, and beyond; these fields make extensive use of
    models&mdash;paradigms constructed in order to reduce something complicated to a simpler form. As George Box
    correctly noted, something must be lost in the reduction from reality to model, meaning any model must be
    wrong&mdash;incomplete or otherwise flawed in a way that makes it inaccurate on the whole.<span class="fn">
      <a id="ref-1" href="#fn-1">[1]</a>:792
    </span> However, despite their drawbacks, many can still be useful, due to the increased comprehensibility derived
    from the process of modelling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tables in the chemistry data booklet are reference, or literature, values&mdash;the &ldquo;right&rdquo; numbers
    as opposed to whatever we might deduce from our own experiments&mdash;and we treat them as always correct. However,
    these are defined only for standard conditions and might be different under different conditions. Bond enthalpy, the
    energy required to break a bond, in particular is known to be only an average value because a bond between the same
    two atoms will behave differently in every different compound in which it is found. The notion of such a
    &ldquo;literature value&rdquo; for bond enthalpy is a model within chemistry, and though it is &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;
    in this way it is still useful to chemists and chemistry students as a point of comparison for experiments.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Another well-known model in the natural sciences, at the edge of modern physics, is the Standard Model. This is the
    theory that seeks to construct physics, up from the smallest things in the Universe to everything we observe, from
    eighteen fundamental particles. It breaks down matter even further than atoms, into six &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of
    quarks, which make up particles like protons and neutrons; six leptons, which include electrons; and six bosons,
    which are responsible for the forces by which the others interact and for giving them all
    mass.<a class="fn" id="ref-2a" href="#fn-2">[2]</a> Since the groundwork was laid for quantum physics in the 1890s,
    and increasingly since the Standard Model was fully theorized in the 1970s, hundreds of experiments have confirmed
    the behaviors that it predicts, and these experiments have helped physicists continue to build and refine the theory
    during that time.<span class="fn"><a id="ref-3a" href="#fn-3">[3]</a><a id="ref-4" href="#fn-4">[4]</a></span>
    Recently, the discoveries of quantum physicists have also been contributing to the growing field of quantum
    computing, which promises to revolutionize information technology with previously-unknown computing
    power.<a class="fn" id="ref-5" href="#fn-5">[5]</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Standard Model is not, however, without its shortcomings: many of the major open questions in physics revolve
    around its holes. Notably, it does not explain &ldquo;dark matter&rdquo; or &ldquo;dark energy,&rdquo; which
    together are believed to make up about 95% of the Universe, and it is irreconcilable with Einstein&rsquo;s general
    theory of relativity and thus the modern theory of gravity.<a class="fn" id="ref-3b" href="#fn-3">[3]</a> The
    existence of the Higgs boson was also not confirmed until 2012, and even now many of its properties are somewhat
    contentious.<a class="fn" id="ref-2b" href="#fn-2">[2]</a> Despite these apparently significant gaps, the Standard
    Model has thus far done a very good job of predicting and, to some extent, explaining the results of various
    experiments in quantum physics and beyond. It could be argued that it is &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; because of what it
    fails to explain, but then most laws and theories in physics only work in certain conditions; the Standard Model is
    remarkably useful because it provides a framework for describing what classical physics long struggled to (and still
    cannot) make sense of.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In 1930 and 1931, Kurt G&ouml;del published two results that now underlie the study of mathematical logic, or
    &ldquo;meta-mathematics&rdquo; in a sense. The Incompleteness Theorems state, in simplified terms: for any
    &ldquo;formal system,&rdquo; (1) so long as no statement can be proven both true and false, there are statements
    that cannot be proven nor disproven, making the system <em>incomplete</em>; and (2) it cannot be proven that the
    system is <em>consistent</em>&mdash;no statement is both true and false&mdash;within
    itself.<a class="fn" id="ref-6a" href="#fn-6">[6]</a> Though the actual proof of these is rather complicated, and
    jargon tends to render discussions of them nearly incomprehensible, the implications of these theorems are
    staggering. They mean that as long as we avoid contradictions in math, a fundamental property of proofs, it is
    impossible to prove every possible result: there will always be things we do not know, some part of the field
    perpetually beyond our reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems could be construed to show that math itself is wrong. Indeed, many people
    have done so, calling G&ouml;del&rsquo;s notion &ldquo;math&rsquo;s fundamental
    flaw,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="ref-7" href="#fn-7">[7]</a> a &ldquo;paradox at its
    heart.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="ref-8" href="#fn-8">[8]</a> At the time of his writing, other mathematicians had
    begun to define &ldquo;formal systems&rdquo; of mathematics, identifying the axioms&mdash;fundamental statements
    assumed to be true&mdash;on which the discipline rests.<a class="fn" id="ref-6b" href="#fn-6">[6]</a> These are
    models, but really they are models of a model, our system of notation and expression of mathematical concepts being
    itself one large model for the abstract nature of math. G&ouml;del has thus not demonstrated that math is wrong but
    that our model of it&mdash;along with any other model of it we could think to create&mdash;is wrong. Yet it must
    still be useful, or else we would not require children to spend twelve years learning it, nor build from it an
    entire academic discipline in which researchers cling to the hope of improving the tools and knowledge available to
    the rest of the world.

    One of the most impactful books on my education&mdash;though I did not read it for school&mdash;is <em>
      Math on Trial
    </em>, in which mother-daughter author duo Leila Schneps and Coralie Colmez provide ten examples of &ldquo;how math
    is used and abused in the courtroom.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="ref-9a" href="#fn-9">[9]</a> Several involve models in
    some form, among these the case of Sylvia Ann Howland&rsquo;s death.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1865, one specific instance of her signature was accused of being a forgery, and Benjamin Peirce, a Harvard
    mathematician, was summoned as an expert witness in the fraud case. In his testimony, he used the data from
    comparisons of 42 samples of Howland&rsquo;s signature to determine whether it was real or fake. He approximated the
    set of pairwise comparisons among this data with a statistical distribution that was close to the data he was given,
    but not identical, leading him to calculate the probability that two of her signatures, taken at random, would be
    exactly the same&mdash;as were the two on two pages of her will&mdash;as 1 in 931 quintillion, so microscopically
    small that the specimen he was presented with must have been a forgery. However, the model he constructed was
    flawed, overestimating the number of signatures that were very different and underestimating the number that were
    quite similar. This means that his approximation severely discounted the possibility of two signatures being exactly
    equal and made forgery seem like a much more likely outcome than it may actually have been.<span class="fn">
      <a id="ref-9b" href="#fn-9">[9]</a>:177&ndash;181
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Peirce&rsquo;s model was nearly useless as evidence to his point because it missed the nuances of the
    situation&mdash;not only that the approximation diverged from the truth in a crucial part of the data, but also
    because he ignored the pragmatics, such as that two signatures written at the same desk with the same pen are rather
    likely to look nearly identical.<span class="fn"><a id="ref-9c" href="#fn-9">[9]</a>:181</span> This makes it wrong
    and, though the binomial distribution he used is valuable in many situations, not useful in a court of law. And
    there are many more examples, from 1865 to the present, of mathematical models being constructed in a way that
    misleads people, whether intentionally or unintentionally, usually involving statistics or probability as this case
    did. This can be done by ignoring (or simply failing to consider) information that would counter the claim the model
    seeks to make, as well as by omitting assumptions that have been made in order to support that claim. Though these
    presentations combine inaccuracy and inutility, that does not preclude Box&rsquo;s statement from being true
    overall: he said some, not all, models are useful.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In chemistry, a model simplifies an infinite number of possibilities down to a single value. In physics, a model
    attempts to describe the workings of the entire Universe with just eighteen particles. In math, a model draws a
    conclusion from incomplete information, while another shows that the whole system in which it exists is inherently
    incomplete. All of these point to the idea, which the last proves, that no model can be infallibly
    correct&mdash;there are holes in it somewhere. Yet, at the forefront of research in mathematics and in the natural
    sciences, experts all over the world use these models on a daily basis to study things as concrete as heat and
    energy and as abstract as mathematical logic. Even while other &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are using similar models to
    manipulate information, they demonstrate that some are incredibly useful in a wide range of applications despite
    their inevitable limitations. Therefore, it can be concluded that George Box may have oversimplified his claim, but
    his idea was accurate.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has implications for knowledge in all areas and for all knowers. Everything we know comes in models because our
    minds do not contain all of reality. Yuval Noah Harari, in his book <em>Sapiens</em>, thus extends Box&rsquo;s
    statement to all knowledge: &ldquo;The real test of &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; is not whether it is true, but whether
    it empowers us.&hellip; [N]o theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The
    real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge.&rdquo;<span class="fn">
