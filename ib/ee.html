  <h1>A century of Jewish assimilation through music</h1>
  <h3>IB Extended Essay in Music <br> 3 March 2025</h3>

  <p id="rq">Research question: to what extent does the parallel evolution of klezmer music and Reform Jewish liturgical
    music in the U.S. exemplify the tendency of Jewish subcultures toward assimilation?</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="block">
    &ldquo;I am in my holiest place when I pray using the power of music. My experience is highly enhanced when I am
    surrounded by community, as our voices fill the air with exquisite harmonies.&rdquo; &mdash;Rob Aronson
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
    The Jewish experience is inextricably defined by music. From Biblical times, with the Song of the Sea in Exodus 15,
    to the present day, with Aronson&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Havah Nashirah</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Let Us Sing&rdquo;), Jews
    sing to connect with each other and with
    God. But these two songs are very different in many ways: the fact that Aronson used more English than Hebrew in the
    lyrics, that he included chords for guitar or piano with the vocals, and even that he was able to write down the
    music and share it with people he had never met&mdash;such as myself&mdash;are all much more recent than the story
    of Moses.
    While they would have been possible for no one three thousand years ago, they would still not be possible for Jews
    if we had not borrowed these things from surrounding cultures&mdash;especially in the United States&mdash;over the
    last couple
    of centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jews began to immigrate to the U.S. from Central Europe in the 1830s, bringing with them Reform Judaism, which had
    grown out of the Enlightenment. As the Reform movement spread throughout the U.S., it diverged from the religious
    practices of Orthodoxy but maintained a similar style of religious music, which remained common in its synagogues
    for more than a century. During the Gilded Age&mdash;roughly 1880 to 1924&mdash;many more Jewish immigrants arrived
    from all
    over Europe, with those from Eastern Europe especially carrying the music of their communities outside of the
    synagogue. This is the music that would become popular alongside the rise of jazz and become known as &ldquo;klezmer
    music&rdquo; later in the twentieth century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these forms of music&mdash;that of the Reform synagogue and that of the <em>klezmer</em>&mdash;still exist,
    but their modern
    forms would be nearly unrecognizable to the European immigrants who first brought them to this continent. This paper
    explores how this happened, answering the question, <strong>to what extent does the parallel evolution of klezmer
      music and
      Reform Jewish liturgical music in the U.S. exemplify the tendency of Jewish subcultures toward
      assimilation?</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Rise of klezmer</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    The Yiddish word <em>klezmer</em> comes from the Hebrew phrase <em>k&rsquo;lei-zemer</em>, which literally means
    &ldquo;vessels of song.&rdquo; It was
    commonly used in Eastern Europe to denote a musician, usually one who would perform traditional dance music at
    weddings and other festive events. <em>Klezmorim</em> (plural of klezmer) were often employed in the late 1700s and
    1800s by
    Hasidic congregations as the movement grew throughout the region, especially to enhance their dances and
    <em>nigunim</em>
    (word-less melodies). This had a lasting influence on the style of music the klezmorim developed, now also known as
    klezmer: &ldquo;melodies of clearly Hasidic origin formed a significant part of the Eastern European klezmer
    repertory &hellip;
    and until recently klezmer musicians &hellip; have had little reason to differentiate Hasidic material from other
    parts of
    the repertory.&rdquo; This was augmented by traditional styles of other Jewish spheres: &ldquo;typical klezmer
    ornaments are
    also found in other forms of Jewish musical expression including cantorial music and folksong. The cantorial
    parallel is evident in the shape and phrasing of instrumental improvisations.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    Between 1881 and 1924, more than 2.5 million Jews immigrated from Eastern Europe to the U.S., bringing with them
    their religious practices&mdash;overwhelmingly Hasidic, with a minority following other branches of
    Orthodoxy&mdash;and their
    music. The klezmorim among them &ldquo;re-created the sounds of eastern Europe&rsquo;s cities and towns on this side
    of
    the
    ocean,&rdquo; using musical elements from cultures across that region and common klezmer instruments such as the
    tsimbl,
    accordion, and valve trombone. By the end of this period, though, there were distinct breaks from the tradition in
    favor of more &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; local music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figure 1 shows the intersection of Eastern European klezmer and &rsquo;20s jazz. Recorded in 1927 by Abe
    Schwartz&rsquo;s
    orchestra, &ldquo;Lebedik un Freylekh&rdquo; appends to a distinctly American instrumentation&mdash;brass, piano,
    banjo, and drum
    set&mdash;the clarinet, violin, and valve trombone of klezmer.
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 1: &ldquo;Lebedik un Freylekh&rdquo; as recorded by Abe Schwartz</p>
  <img class="tall" src="imgs/ee1.png" />
  <p class="noindent">
    While the chords under these two bars are Dm, as noted on the banjo part, the presence of B&natur; and G&sharp; in
    the melody
    puts the song in D double-harmonic minor, also known as the Gypsy minor scale, giving it a feel that might be
    described as &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; and is reminiscent of the Eastern European origins of klezmer music. At the same
    time, it
    has an American-jazz sound because of the included instruments that would never have been used in that Eastern
    European music. It was created for Jews who had come to the U.S., familiar with the klezmer tunes but wanting to
    hear something that reflected their experience as immigrants&mdash;as Americans.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figure 2 shows the same effect from a different perspective. &ldquo;<em>Nokh a Bisl</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Little Bit
    More&rdquo;) is a traditional
    klezmer song. Con Conrad and J. Russel Robinson took the melody and transformed it into the jazz that they were used
    to with &ldquo;Lena from Palesteena&rdquo; (1920).
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 2: &ldquo;Nokh a Bisl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lena from Palesteena&rdquo;</p>
  <img class="square" src="imgs/ee2.png" />
  <p>
    Both of these are also in D double-harmonic minor. In &ldquo;Palesteena,&rdquo; the turns became triplets to conform
    to
    the popular swing style; the second half changed from a natural extension of the opening to a busy, syncopated
    counter-melody, with F&sharp;s and C&sharp;s to give it a major feel. The goal here may not have been to appeal to a
    Jewish
    audience but to reach mainstream audiences with a novel sound, cleaning up this &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; music to make
    it more
    acceptable.
  </p>

  <h2>Synagogue music</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    At the same time, the music that had spawned klezmer hundreds of years earlier lived on in a much more traditional
    form, in the synagogue. Though music had been present in the liturgy since the First Temple period, around the sixth
    and seventh centuries BC, in the Diaspora (Jews outside of Israel) this music evolved over time based on the music
    they heard around them. The <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> provides, &ldquo;The music may have preserved a few phrases
    in the
    reading
    of Scripture which recalled the song of the Temple &hellip; but generally it echoed from the first the tones which
    the Jew
    of each age and country heard around him, not merely in the actual borrowing of tunes &hellip; but more especially
    in the
    prevailing tonality or description of scale on which the music was based.&rdquo; It provides the example, shown in
    figure
    3, of an excerpt from the weekday evening liturgy, the end of the &ldquo;Redemption&rdquo; prayer. This segment
    contains no
    sevenths, so its scale is not fully defined, but it begins in the Lydian scale&mdash;with the raised fourth,
    B&natur;&mdash;but
    switches to a normal fourth, returning to the major scale for the end of the blessing.
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 3: excerpt from the weekday evening service</p>
  <img class="long" src="imgs/ee3.png" />
  <p class="noindent">
    At this point, the music of the U.S. synagogue was very much an insular style as compared to the music around it;
    while this Lydian/major motif may have arisen from several possible sources in the past, the contemporary music
    would not have used that at all, but that had not yet affected the Jewish canon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to his death in 1938, Abraham Zevi Idelsohn compiled a <em>Jewish Song Book for Synagogue, School and
      Home</em>, which
    includes the music for nearly every song popular in the Ashkenazic tradition at the time and the liturgy of every
    service of the year. Figure 4 shows an excerpt from the book, the two versions of the Priestly Benediction in the
    section for the Three Festivals. The &ldquo;Solo&rdquo; sections would be sung by the cantor, while the
    &ldquo;Unison or Choir&rdquo;
    sections are affirmations of the blessings that the cantor is giving.
  </p>
  <p class="caption">

  </div>
  <p class="noindent">
    In the first of these songs, the key signature with one flat would seem to imply a key in D minor. The tonal center
    throughout the solo sections, however, is G, and the presence of E&flat;, F&sharp;, and the occasional C&sharp; in
    the chords
    underneath implies a G harmonic minor or double-harmonic minor scale; meanwhile, the unison sections favor D major
    chords, though there are also elements of D minor. The second tune lies more consistently in A&flat; major, as the
    key
    signature would imply, with some E&natur;s&mdash;implying F harmonic minor&mdash;and venturing into C harmonic
    minor, with D&natur; and B&natur;,
    for the second unison section. The use of harmonic minor scales and the variations between minor and major echo the
    traditional music of the Jews of Eastern Europe, which picked up elements of the music of the region and its
    &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; sound before it arrived in the U.S.
  </p>

  <h2>Klezmer revival</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    Following its popularity in the 1930s, klezmer music saw a decline in public appreciation in the U.S. due to the
    destruction of Jewish communities in Europe during the Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
  </p>
  <p class="block">
    In 1977, Nat Hentoff commented that &ldquo;For years now, I had thought the klezmorim to be nearly extinct. Oh, some
    old
    players must still be boldly wailing in some dwindling Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, but surely they are the last
    of their line.&rdquo; When he heard them, he &ldquo;would close his eyes and grin at the ghosts of my clan in Minsk
    and Pinsk.&rdquo;
    Now, he continued, a new generation has &ldquo;taken up and merrily revivified this heritage.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    The &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; created a movement that became known as the &ldquo;klezmer revival.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Its origins in the late &rsquo;70s
    can be found in the confluence of the larger American &lsquo;roots&rsquo; and folk music movements, &lsquo;folk
    music&rsquo; being the
    musical department of the alternative youth scene at that time. The musicians who initiated the klezmer revival to a
    large extent started out playing bluegrass, old-timey, and other American traditional music genres, and these
    musicians jumped at the chance to have their very own folk music.&rdquo; Among these were &ldquo;young Jewish
    musicians &hellip; asking
    questions about their musical ancestry,&rdquo; who had been &ldquo;imbued with the aesthetic of 1960s
    self-expression&rdquo; and
    played &ldquo;the raw musical styles of blues, bluegrass, old-time swing, jazz, folk, and soul.&rdquo; As they
    developed their
    own &ldquo;new klezmer&rdquo; music, they drew inspiration from these other styles that they had already learned,
    and with this
    music they created a folk style that had never been seen before in the klezmer genre.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of these musicians was mandolinist and clarinetist Andy Statman, who drew on his experience in bluegrass to
    create klezmer with guitar as the rhythmic underpinning, a new element in klezmer. Figure 5 shows an excerpt from
    one of his songs from this era, &ldquo;Flatbush Waltz&rdquo; (1980).
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 5: Andy Statman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flatbush Waltz&rdquo;</p>
  <img class="tall" src="imgs/ee5.png" />
  <p class="noindent">
    While the instrumentation is novel, the musical elements of this melody are nothing new&mdash;the ornamentation of
    rhythms
    is a common element from earlier klezmer, and from the tonal center of G the melody occupies a variety of minor
    scales, including the stereotypically Semitic harmonic minor, with the accidentals on F&sharp; and A&flat; in
    addition to F&natur;
    and A&natur;. The &ldquo;revival&rdquo; movement of which he was part sought to reinstate the popularity of this
    music by bringing it
    back into public view and making it look like the common music of the time, without changing its fundamental
    aspects. At the same time, the melding of styles in this period was a relatively novel concept in music as a whole,
    facilitated by an ability to share music around the world in a way that would not have been possible a few decades
    earlier, but fit neatly into the klezmer that had arisen in the U.S.
  </p>

  <h2>The modern liturgy</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    Associated with the movements in music that led to the klezmer revival in the late 1970s were corresponding
    movements in American-Jewish cultural identity. Alicia Svigals defines these in three groups&mdash;&ldquo;the one
    that discards
    the culture and keeps the religion, the one that discards the religion and keeps the culture, and the one that
    uncritically embraces both,&rdquo; which she calls Jewish Renewal, Yiddishism, and Ba&rsquo;al T&rsquo;shuvah
    (literally &ldquo;master of
    return&rdquo;), respectively. She writes, &ldquo;The first two are made up of Jews who identify with the progressive
    left. These
    are people who are looking for a way of being Jewish that is consonant with their feminist, gay-positive, and other
    new-left values, and that does away with the social strictures of the past: that is, a way of being Jewish while
    still being themselves.&rdquo; These ideologies arose from the Reform and Reconstructionist denominations but
    reflected a
    political shift that had not yet been seen in the synagogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jewish Renewal movement especially draws on the &ldquo;new-left&rdquo; philosophy, with the prominent
    singer-songwriter
    Debbie Friedman rethinking religious texts in light of a new mindset. She took the Mourner&rsquo;s Kaddish&mdash;as
    the name
    implies, a prayer for the dead&mdash;and chose &ldquo;to interpret this prayer as it is written&mdash;as an
    affirmation of life and
    the glorification of God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Mi Shebeirach&rdquo; (1989), shown in figure 6, she modified
    the
    liturgy &ldquo;to reflect
    a feminist sensibility,&rdquo; including both &lsquo;<em>avoteinu</em>&rsquo; (our fathers) and
    &lsquo;<em>imoteinu</em>&rsquo; (our mothers) as a way of
    demonstrating that neither God nor the people fit into a single gender category.
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 6: Debbie Friedman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mi Shebeirach&rdquo;</p>
  <img class="tall" src="imgs/ee6.png" />
  <p class="noindent">
    Gone are the accidentals and ornaments that would give the melody a distinct sound, as is any assumption of roles in
    the synagogue that would be important for this song. Instead, Friedman writes a simple melody in A major, with chord
    notation for a guitar or piano accompaniment, like the rock or folk of the time; more importance is placed on the
    lyrics, mixing Hebrew and English to make the message more accessible, so the song becomes a vehicle for emotion and
    personal connection. In general, Svigals writes, her lyrics were set to &ldquo;to beautiful, spiritual melodies
    which for
    the most part draw on an American popular music vocabulary.&rdquo; Her longtime friend Jeff Klepper describes some
    of her
    songs as &ldquo;in a blues-jazz style associated more with singers like Billie Holiday&rdquo; or &ldquo;dated, like
    outtakes from the
    musical <em>Hair</em>.&rdquo; Increasingly, at the hands of musicians like Friedman (and Klepper), the music of the
    Reform
    synagogue became less like the style Idelsohn chronicles, with a virtuosic cantor and a full choir, and more like
    the folk acts that were very popular beyond the synagogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debbie Friedman&rsquo;s music is still incredibly popular throughout the U.S. Reform movement, with some of her
    songs
    (including &ldquo;Mi Shebeirach&rdquo;) becoming so well-known that many think of them as traditional. At my
    synagogue, we
    continue the same trend of bringing the traditional music into a modern context with the music of Friedman, Klepper,
    Dan Nichols, Craig Taubman, and more. We have monthly services where original arrangements of this music are
    performed by the teen band, which has the appearance of a high-school chamber ensemble, introducing elements of
    contemporary Western-classical music; annually, on the Friday before MLK Day, our Reform Jewish music is mixed with
    the Gospel music of a Black church choir, reinforcing the values of redemption and justice that we so often sing and
    pray about on our own. All of this is symbolic of the integration of the Jewish community into mainstream culture
    but simultaneously represents a powerful resistance to complete assimilation as we continue to celebrate our unique
    ideas and beliefs.
  </p>

  <h2>Today&rsquo;s klezmer</h2>
  <p class="block">
    &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you call that, but that&rsquo;s not klezmer.&rdquo; If I had a dollar for every time
    I exited a concert by
    Brave Old World or Golem and overheard someone saying this, I&rsquo;d be, as the saying goes, a rich man. I hate to
    disappoint you, but yes, it is klezmer. And not only is it klezmer, it is part and parcel of the klezmer tradition;
    indeed, it is <em>traditional</em> klezmer, because klezmer has always spoken in the idiom of its time.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
    Seth Rogovoy&rsquo;s point in writing this is that the genre has continued to evolve; the revival of the 1970s never
    really ended, in the sense that klezmer continues to blend into the music scene around it. It draws more inspiration
    from the present than from its own past, so it does not sound like the music that was played fifty years ago.
    Instead, the title of his article provides, &ldquo;rock, jazz, punk, hip-hop, and techno bring new sounds to the
    Jewish
    mix.&rdquo; Rogovoy goes on to assert &ldquo;that there is no such thing as &lsquo;klezmer music&rsquo; at
    all&rdquo; because it is defined so
    much by the musical culture that surrounds it. &ldquo;[T]he need to define klezmer &hellip; is &hellip; totally
    unnecessary. Much better
    to follow tradition and embrace a wider approach, as the [Eastern European Jewish] musicians often did,
    incorporating &lsquo;co-territorial&rsquo; and &lsquo;cosmopolitan&rsquo; influences into their music.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    David Krakauer is one of the leading musicians in this movement, joining his old-time klezmer clarinet sound with
    modern styles of rock, jazz, and hip-hop. This influence is demonstrated in &ldquo;Der Heyser Bulgar&rdquo; (c.
    2009), the
    beginning of which is shown in figure 7.
  </p>
  <p class="caption">figure 7: David Krakauer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der Heyser Bulgar&rdquo;</p>
  <img class="tall" src="imgs/ee7.png" />
  <p class="noindent">
    Krakauer makes extensive use of minor accidentals; while the song is written in concert D major, the use of the
    &flat;2,
    &flat;6, and &flat;7 puts the tune in the Phrygian dominant (or harmonic dominant) scale. Meanwhile, the melody
    frequently
    includes A&sharp;, in addition to A&natur;, hinting to the double-harmonic minor scale and thus the Eastern European
    origins of
    klezmer. While the ghost notes and trills are commonplace as ornamentation in klezmer, some of these same elements,
    along with the triplet rhythms, draw parallels with contemporary jazz.
  </p>
  <p>
    With artists such as Krakauer on his clarinet, Frank London and Kaia &ldquo;Chaia&rdquo; Berman-Peters playing
    electronic
    klezmer, and the Shvesters (Yiddish for &lsquo;sisters&rsquo;) singing jazz-age classics in Yiddish, modern klezmer
    is defined
    by its lack of definition, with every musician and musicologist having different ideas of what it is and what it
    should be. It is jazz, it is blues, it is punk, it is techno, it is electronica, and it is folk; &ldquo;Andy Statman
    can
    pull out his mandolin and convince you that bluegrass was handed down to the Israelites at Mount Sinai &hellip;
    pianist
    Anthony Coleman can play &lsquo;Mayn Shtetele Belz&rsquo; and convince you that the Buena Vista Social Club from
    Havana is the
    house band of one of the Ten Lost Tribes.&rdquo; The unique style of each of these musicians is supported by the
    community
    surrounding its primary genr&mdash;whether or not that is klezmer&mdash;and bolstered by the audience that
    specifically seeks
    music they can connect with as Jews or enjoyers of Jewish music.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Jewish music?</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    This question underlies this entire exploration, and Jews and non-Jews alike have sought to answer it for more than
    a hundred years. Curt Sachs defined it as &ldquo;music made by Jews, for Jews, as Jews;&rdquo; Alexander Knapp
    counters this by
    asking, &ldquo;Does this statement imply that anything composed <em>not by</em> Jews, <em>not for</em> Jews, <em>not
      as</em> Jews, would, <em>ipso facto</em>,
    be not Jewish music?&rdquo; and proceeds to give several examples of songs that, to an ordinary reader, obviously do
    fall
    into the category of &ldquo;Jewish music&rdquo; but do not meet all three of Sachs&rsquo;s criteria. Cyrus Adler and
    Francis Cohen in
    the <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> and Abraham Idelsohn in the <em>Jewish Song Book</em> each attempted to classify
    the music of their
    time by compiling the melodies and motifs, and both created products that are hard to read or use due to the sheer
    amount of information they have tried to condense to a reasonable size.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple scholars, Knapp not least among them, argue that the question is futile. In a meta-article on the topic,
    Mark Slobin writes, &ldquo;The mirage of Jewish music evaporates as you gaze at it, replaced by the vision of a
    group of
    Jews singing whatever they like, from any local source.&rdquo; In other articles, Charles Hersch and Lloica Czackis
    have
    examined the genres of &ldquo;Jewish jazz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yiddish tango,&rdquo; and Jonathan Magonet has discussed
    the influence of
    Jewish-written songs on popular culture. There is also something to be said about the idea of notation: traditional
    music would never have been written down, yet today all the music we play is transcribed&mdash;in a system that
    originated
    in Western Europe, which is not the origin of the majority of the culture&mdash;and even as far back as the early
    1900s,
    there was a perceived need to write it down, as evidenced by the images near the beginning of this paper. Jewish
    music on the whole does not exist in and of itself but is defined by its surroundings, as &ldquo;the music of an
    extraordinarily mobile, widely dispersed, and frequently persecuted &lsquo;people&rsquo; who cannot easily be
    defined by
    &lsquo;homeland,&rsquo; &lsquo;race,&rsquo; &lsquo;ethnicity,&rsquo; &lsquo;nationality&rsquo; or
    &lsquo;religion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
  </p>

  <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
  <p class="block">
    &ldquo;[R]itual music is a deeply sensual experience that touches people in a way that words cannot. Music converts
    the
    ordinary into the miraculous, and individuals into a community of prayer. And music enables overly-intellectual Jews
    to rest their minds and open their hearts.&rdquo; —Eric Yoffie
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
    This paper has traversed the last 120 years of Jewish and Jewish-adjacent music in the U.S., stopping to consider
    defining moments in the evolution of klezmer music and Reform liturgical music. Klezmer &ldquo;came off the
    boat&rdquo; from
    Europe and found itself surrounded by a rapidly growing jazz culture, which brought it into the public eye for a
    decade; resurged in the 1970s due to culture shifts in folk and soul music; and has retained a sort of cult
    following to the present as a representation of Jewish (or Jewish-inspired) jazz-folk. Meanwhile, the music of the
    Reform synagogue has grown apart from its united origins with that of the Orthodox synagogue as it detached itself
    from antiquated language, took on the styles and practices of secular genres, and began to prioritize ideological
    partnerships over religious particularism. All of this is entirely in line with what the Jewish community in the
    U.S. as a whole was doing over the same period, growing from a single culture that looked roughly like today&rsquo;s
    Modern Orthodox into a set of subcultures as diverse as the rest of the country that surrounded them.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is this diversification&mdash;and, in this case, secularization&mdash;that defines the pattern of assimilation.
    Though there
    were some nuanced differences between different parts of the Jewish community in the early 1900s, to someone who had
    spent their whole life within the contemporary mainstream society, it would have appeared to be a
    unit&mdash;&ldquo;the Jews.&rdquo;
    However, no culture is truly homogenous, so in order to fit in the Jews had to divide into their own subcultures
    that mirrored those of the dominant culture, all the while letting go of the things that made them most unique
    because they would have also made them targets for persecution. Therefore, today, we are left with a community that,
    while undoubtedly retaining some defining features and facing persecution and discrimination, has blended well
    enough into mainstream America that the average person cannot tell us apart. Judaism is, as ever, an interesting
    oddity&mdash;with a language and history that stand out&mdash;but otherwise invisible.
