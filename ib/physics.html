  <h1 class="phys">Viscosity and flow rate in a large tube</h1>
  <h3 class="phys">IB Physics SL <br> 3 February 2024</h3>

  <p id="noindent">Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to flow, or of the effect of applied stress on
    its motion. Dynamic or absolute viscosity is an intrinsic property of a substance, dependent on temperature: as a
    liquid gets colder, its viscosity increases; the opposite is true for gases, meaning a substance&rsquo;s minimum
    viscosity is at its boiling point. There is no general equation for viscosity in terms of other intrinsic
    properties, but there are many ways to determine it experimentally, resulting in the units of Pa&centerdot;s, or
    poise (P) where 1 cP = 1 mPa&centerdot;s. In some applications the preferred metric is kinematic viscosity, defined
    by <math>
      <mi>&nu;</mi>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mi>&mu;</mi>
      <mo>/</mo>
      <mi>&rho;</mi>
    </math>, or absolute viscosity divided by density, and measured in m<sup>2</sup>/s, or stokes (St) where 1 St = 1
    cm<sup>2</sup>/s. In non-technical terms, a more viscous fluid is &ldquo;thicker,&rdquo; and therefore moves more
    slowly, but I wanted to know the quantitative relationship: how does viscosity affect flow rate?</p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Average';">In an open container that is much wider than it is deep and has a constant depth
    and a downward slope, such as a
    wide river, the flow of liquid through it can be modeled by layers of liquid with increasing speeds as they go up.
    With a derivation too long and complicated to repeat, the equation that represents the total flow rate is <math>
      <mi>Q</mi>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mi>g</mi>
      <mi>w</mi>
      <msup>
        <mi>h</mi>
        <mn>3</mn>
      </msup>
      <mi>sin(&theta;)</mi>
      <mo>/</mo>
      <mn>3</mn>
      <mi>&nu;</mi>
    </math>, where <em>g</em> is gravitational acceleration, <em>w</em> is the width, <em>h</em> is the constant depth,
    &theta; is the downward angle of the container, and &nu; is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. (There is another,
    more popular equation for flow rate in terms of viscosity, <math>
      <mi>Q</mi>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mi>&pi;</mi>
      <mi>&Delta;</mi>
      <mi>P</mi>
      <msup>
        <mi>r</mi>
        <mn>4</mn>
      </msup>
      <mo>/</mo>
      <mn>8</mn>
      <mi>&mu;</mi>
      <mi>L</mi>
    </math>, but it only applies when the motion of the fluid is caused by a difference in pressure.) This investigation
    seeks to empirically confirm this relationship by creating many small rivers with varying viscosities.</p>

  <h2 class="phys">Procedure</h2>
  <p id="noindent">Set up a system that models the flow of liquid in a river with a tube. The example shown in figure 1
    is a rough
    sketch of my setup, but there are other ways to make this work.</p>
  <p id="caption">figure 1: diagram of setup</p>
  <img src="imgs/physics1.png" />
  <p>In this system, a tube or pipe, longer than it is wide, is suspended by supports (I used books) and secured to them
    so it will not move around (I used masking tape for this). At the bottom end of the tube is some container to
    collect the fluid after it flows through the tube in order to conserve materials and prevent messes. Record the
    heights of two or more points on the tube and the distance(s) between them, which will be treated as constant (I
    chose the attachment points as well as the two endpoints of the tube).</p>
  <p>Gather approximately 100 mL of each of seven liquids with distinct viscosities. For each, conduct at least three
    trials of pouring it into the top of the tube (I used a 100 mL graduated cylinder to do this) and letting it flow to
    the bottom. Measure the amount of time from the start of pouring until the end of the main flow of liquid, at which
    point it will no longer behave like a river (exactly how this is defined is not so important as long as it is
    consistent across trials). Record also, between trials, how much of the liquid remains, to see if there might be
    patterns that could skew the data (for example, I used two alcohols, which evaporate at room temperature, so a
    substantial amount was lost over the course of the trials).</p>
  <p>Between trials involving different liquids, rinse out all dirty containers and equipment (including the tube if
    necessary) to prevent cross-contamination. When the experiment is complete, rinse out equipment again for storage,
    and clean up any spilled liquid in the lab area.</p>

  <h2 class="phys">Data</h2>
  <p id="noindent">Table 1 shows the data collected over three data-collection sessions, time for the liquid to flow
    down the tube and
    the volume of liquid used for each trial.</p>

  <p id="noindent">There is substantial variation among the volume values for some of the substances, due to evaporation
    in the case of alcohols or sticking to the tube and other equipment in some cases. As I was recording the data I
    noticed that these patterns did not always align to the trends in the time data and did not conform to my prior
    expectations in some cases (e.g., syrup is stickier than mineral oil, but little was lost over the trials).</p>
  <p>In order to quantify the independent variable&mdash;different substances&mdash;I found reference values online for
    both absolute and kinematic viscosities for the seven substances I used, shown in table 2. Uncertainty is considered
    to be 0 for all of these because they are reference values.</p>

  <h2 class="phys">Uncertainty and error</h2>
  <p>The tables above have marked uncertainties for each value, but those do not tell the whole story in some cases.
    The
    uncertainty in each time measurement in table 1 is &plusmn; 0.01 s because I obtained them using a digital
    stopwatch
    precise to two decimal places, and the volume values have uncertainties of &plusmn; 0.5 mL, or &plusmn; 500
    mm<sup>3</sup>, because they were determined using the markings on the graduated cylinder I used to hold the
    liquids. Converting these to percentages for each trial and propagating appropriately, we find that each flow rate
    value in table 4 has a percent uncertainty between about 0.5% and 1.0%, meaning the uncertainty in each average is
    also somewhere in that range: about &plusmn; 270 mm<sup>3</sup>/s for water, &plusmn; 20 mm<sup>3</sup>/s for
    vegetable oil, etc. However, the data points vary more widely than this accounts for, so a better measure of
    uncertainty is the semi-range. This is where the values come from that define the error bars in figures 2 and 3,
    with about &plusmn; 6750 mm<sup>3</sup>/s for water, &plusmn; 335 mm<sup>3</sup>/s for vegetable oil, and so on.
    Using this, we can do a min-max gradient analysis: as shown in figure 5, the slope of the line could be anywhere
    between 27&thinsp;200 and 225&thinsp;000 and fit within the error bars. (There are no error bars in the
    <em>x</em>-direction, corresponding to viscosity, because I took the reference values as perfectly certain. They
    may
    not be, but none of the sources I found listed uncertainties in their numbers, and I believe it is probably
    insignificant compared to the uncertainty in my own data on the <em>y</em>-axis.)
  </p>
  <p id="caption">figure 5: minimum and maximum slope of the line of best fit</p>
  <img src="imgs/physics5.png" />
  <p id="noindent">The solid green line is the same as in figure 3, and the two dashed blue lines have the minimum and
    maximum slopes according to the error bars shown. From this we conclude that the uncertainty in the slope is the
    greater of 225&thinsp;000 &ndash; 126&thinsp;000 = 99&thinsp;000 and 126&thinsp;000 &ndash; 27&thinsp;200 &approx;
    99&thinsp;000, so we say that the slope of the line is 126&thinsp;000 &plusmn; 99&thinsp;000
    mm<sup>5</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, which is equivalent to 126&thinsp;000 mm<sup>5</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 78%.</p>
  <p>We used this slope value to find other values, first calculating <math>
      <mi>sin(&theta;)</mi>
    </math>. The values in table 3 have uncertainties of &plusmn; 0.1 cm because they were determined using a ruler
    precise to the millimeter, measuring at two points. This means that each of the fractions used to find <math>
      <mi>sin(&theta;)</mi>
    </math> were of the form <math>

    Plugging in values, converting to percentage uncertainties, and simplifying gives five raw uncertainties, of which
    the average is &plusmn; 0.00466. However, the semirange of the values is &plusmn; 0.043, which is larger, so we

      <mo>&plusmn;</mo>

    </math>. Going through the same calculations as we did earlier to find the values of <em>h</em> and <em>w</em> and
    propagating uncertainties along the way, we find that <math>
      <mi>w</mi>
      <msup>
        <mi>h</mi>
        <mn>3</mn>
      </msup>

      <mn>155</mn>
    </math> mm<sup>4</sup> &plusmn; 96%. Making some conservative assumptions about the workings of the calculator, we
    get the values as <em>w</em> = 24.1 mm &plusmn; 15%, or 24.1 mm &plusmn; 3.62 mm, and <em>h</em> = 1.86 mm
    &plusmn;
    27% = <strong>1.86 mm &plusmn; 0.502 mm</strong>.</p>
  <p>This value makes sense intuitively, to a certain extent. As the liquid flowed through the tube, it had a depth
    that
    was quite small relative to the tube (or anything else); around one or two millimeters seems close. For scale,
    this
    is about the size of a duckweed, the smallest flowering plant. I did not measure the height and width of the
    &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; as I was creating them, but the values I calculated, with uncertainty, match my qualitative
    expectations.</p>
  <p>I cannot guarantee, however, that my conclusions are perfect. One potential source of misalignment is random
    error.
    As I conducted the investigation, I did my best to keep everything precise and orderly, but I am not perfect, and
    I
    certainly could not have accounted for everything. The uncertainty discussed in this section is an attempt to
    account for this, in part, but it still leaves room for some margin of error in any experiment. The easiest way to
    reduce the impact of random error is to conduct more trials (potentially with more liquids), or repeat the
    investigation entirely under the same conditions.</p>
  <p>Any discrepancy between the calculated value and the true value could also be partly explained by systematic
    error.
    In this procedure, there are many ways that systematic error may have influenced the data or analysis. One is the
    model: the equation that I used was originally derived using a hypothetical river, but the flows of liquid in this
    experiment are not really rivers, so there are factors at play that might have changed how the terms in the
    equation
    actually impact the relationship. Specifically, it assumes that the width of the flow is much larger than its
    height, but this is not true in my setup, which may have caused the flow rates to be greater than expected and the
    end value for height to be greater accordingly. I could have avoided this by deriving a different equation that
    better represents my experiment, but I figured an equation that a physics professor uses, even if it does not
    apply
    perfectly here, is probably better than my high-school-level attempt to match this specific situation. Another
    source of systematic error is shown by the need for table 3: ideally, I would have run all the trials in a single
    session, and there would only be one value for <math>
      <mi>sin(&theta;)</mi>
    </math>, but high school is not a physics paradise (as much as some might like it to be), and I could not
    replicate
    my setup perfectly; this then leads to a &ldquo;constant&rdquo; value of <math>
      <mi>sin(&theta;)</mi>
    </math> that is correct for none of the trials, which throws a wrench in the math and most likely also caused the
    calculated height value to be inaccurately large. This is not an exhaustive list of examples&mdash;throughout this
    investigation, I have made decisions for the purpose of keeping my experiment bound to realistic conditions and a
    realistic timeframe, all of which may have introduced systematic error in some way. To eliminate this, I could
    have
    acted less in the interest of time and more in the interest of precision, but a balance must be struck. (And
    ultimately, the easiest way to reduce systematic error might have been to choose a different investigation from
    the
    beginning.)</p>

  <h2 class="phys">Conclusion</h2>
  <p id="noindent">Physics is messy. I did not expect to use so many paper towels in my (futile) attempt to keep
    vegetable oil and
    breakfast syrup off the lab table. But that does not mean there are not things to be learned from it. Through this
    investigation, I learned what viscosity means in technical contexts and how it applies to liquid flow. I learned
    how
    to be precise in experimentation, even when working from a vague procedure or no procedure at all. I learned a bit
    about how to quantify things that are not easily quantifiable and not usually quantified. Most importantly,
    though,
    this process of thinking up an experiment, carrying it out, and seeing it through to the end, all the while
    getting
    past whatever obstacles reality decides to throw at me along the way, was quite new to me but will serve me well
    in
    the future. I can now say that I have done it once, and it will be easier the next time. I also determined a value
    for the depth of liquid flowing down a sloped tube by plotting kinematic viscosity against flow time. But that is
    not so important to me; knowing that I am able to do that, mostly by myself, is much more valuable than knowing
    what
    the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; is. Science is not a destination, but a journey, on which everyone embarks because we
    have
    an innate desire to understand ourselves.</p>
