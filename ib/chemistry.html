  <h1>Effect of pH on conductivity of monoprotic and diprotic acid and base solutions</h1>
  <h3>IB Chemistry HL <br> 3 April 2025</h3>

  <p class="noindent">
    Every aqueous solution of an acid or base is in equilibrium: units of acid dissociate into the conjugate base and
    hydrogen ions, while units of base join with hydrogen ions in the water to form the conjugate acid and hydroxide
    ions. The equilibrium constants for these reactions are called the acid and base dissociation constants, <math>

    A strong acid dissociates completely or very nearly completely, producing a lot of H&#8314; ions, while a weak acid
    mostly stays associated, with only a (relatively) small number of free H&#8314; ions forming. Similarly, a strong
    base creates many OH&#8315; ions while a weak base creates relatively few. The pH scale arranges all this in a
    single spectrum, with the weak ends converging to neutrality. It is defined as <math>
      <mo>&ndash;</mo>
      <mi>log</mi>
      <msub>
        <mn>10</mn>
      </msub>
      <mi>[H<msup>+</msup>]</mi>
    </math>, so pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7, while lower numbers are stronger acids and higher numbers
    are stronger bases.<a class="fn" id="ref-2b" href="#fn-2">[2]</a> Similar systems were derived from this for <math>
      <mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>a</mi>
      </msub>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mo>&ndash;</mo>
      <mi>log</mi>
      <msub>
        <mn>10</mn>
      </msub>
      <mi>(</mi>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>a</mi>
      </msub>
      <mi>)</mi>
    </math> and <math>
      <mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>b</mi>
      </msub>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mo>&ndash;</mo>
      <mi>log</mi>
      <msub>
        <mn>10</mn>
      </msub>
      <mi>(</mi>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>b</mi>
      </msub>
      <mi>)</mi>
    </math>; for both, lower numbers correspond to greater presence of ions in the solution and thus stronger acids and
    bases, respectively.<a class="fn" id="ref-1b" href="#fn-1">[1]</a>

    Conductivity is a measure of the ease with which current flows through a substance, the opposite of resistivity.
    Ions are species that carry an electrical charge, so they should more easily carry current than neutral atoms. This
    means that solutions with stronger pH values&mdash;i.e., further from 7&mdash;should be more conductive than
    solutions closer to neutral. In this investigation, I seek to quantify this effect: <strong>how does pH affect
      conductivity, and how does this differ among monoprotic and diprotic acid and base solutions?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In theory, due to the relationship of concentrations given by the equations for <math>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>a</mi>
      </msub>
    </math> and <math>
      <mi>K</mi>
      <msub>
        <mi>b</mi>
      </msub>
    </math>, it should be possible to precisely determine the concentration of a solution that will produce a given pH.
    I used literature data and quadratic regression to find the values in Table 1. The top part of the
    Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> column is missing because the data I used implied that a sodium carbonate solution
    cannot have a pH above about 11.5.
