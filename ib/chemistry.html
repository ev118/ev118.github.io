  <h1>Effect of pH on conductivity of monoprotic and diprotic acid and base solutions</h1>
  <h3>IB Chemistry HL <br> 3 April 2025</h3>

  <p class="noindent">
    Every aqueous solution of an acid or base is in equilibrium: units of acid dissociate into the conjugate base and
    hydrogen ions, while units of base join with hydrogen ions in the water to form the conjugate acid and hydroxide
    ions. The equilibrium constants for these reactions are called the acid and base dissociation constants, <math>

    A strong acid dissociates completely or very nearly completely, producing a lot of H&#8314; ions, while a weak acid
    mostly stays associated, with only a (relatively) small number of free H&#8314; ions forming. Similarly, a strong
    base creates many OH&#8315; ions while a weak base creates relatively few. The pH scale arranges all this in a
    single spectrum, with the weak ends converging to neutrality. It is defined as <math>
      <msub>
        <mi>&ndash;log</mi>
        <mn>10</mn>
      </msub>
      <mi>([H&#8314;])</mi>
    </math>, so pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7, while lower numbers are stronger acids and higher numbers
    are stronger bases.<a class="fn" id="ref-2b" href="#fn-2">[2]</a> Similar systems were derived from this for <math>

    </math>; for both, lower numbers correspond to greater presence of ions in the solution and thus stronger acids and
    bases, respectively.<a class="fn" id="ref-1b" href="#fn-1">[1]</a>

    Conductivity is a measure of the ease with which current flows through a substance, the opposite of resistivity.
    Ions are species that carry an electrical charge, so they should more easily carry current than neutral atoms. This
    means that solutions with stronger pH values&mdash;i.e., further from 7&mdash;should be more conductive than
    solutions closer to neutral. In this investigation, I seek to quantify this effect: <strong>how does pH affect
      conductivity, and how does this differ among monoprotic and diprotic acid and base solutions?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In theory, due to the relationship of concentrations given by the equations for <em>K<sub>a</sub></em> and
    <em>K<sub>b</sub></em>, it should be possible to precisely determine the concentration of a solution that will
    produce a given pH. I used literature data and quadratic regression to find the values in table 1. The top part of
    the Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> column is missing because the data I used implied that a sodium carbonate solution
    cannot have a pH above about 11.5.

  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    The independent variable is pH, as defined in table 1, with a monoprotic and diprotic acid and base each being
    considered individually. The dependent variable is conductivity, as measured by a conductivity probe in &mu;S/cm.
    Factors kept constant include the temperature and pressure of the system, the identity of the substance representing
    each class, and the point at which conductivity is measured.
  </p>

  <h2>Procedure</h2>

  <ol id="chemprod">
    <li>
      Safety: this experiment involves strong caustics, which can be very dangerous if contacted directly. Wear
      appropriate protective gear at all times and be careful with caustic substances.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare eight 150 mL beakers and label two for each of hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and
      sodium carbonate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Measure 1.00 g NaOH and 2.65 g Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in foil dishes using the digital balance. Dissolve
      each of these in 25.0 mL of distilled water, in the respective beakers, using a stir rod, to create 1.00 M
      solutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add some distilled water to a graduated cylinder and, using a clean conductivity probe, identify the conductivity
      of the water. Record this as the value for pH 7 for all four solutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the values in table 1 above and an online calculator<a class="fn" id="ref-4" href="#fn-4">[4]</a> to determine
      the amount of distilled water to add to 5.0
      mL of 1.0 M HCl to create a pH of 1. Add this amount of water to one of the corresponding beakers using the
      graduated cylinder, then add the hydrochloric acid with a pipette, stirring as needed. (Make sure to add the water
      first to avoid potential splattering of acid solution.) Measure the conductivity of the solution and record it
      under pH 1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the table and the same calculator to determine the amount of water to add to 5.0 mL of the pH 1 solution to
      create a pH of 2. Add this much water to the other HCl beaker, using the corresponding cylinder, then add the
      diluted hydrochloric acid with a pipette, stirring as needed. Measure the conductivity of the solution and record
      it under pH 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      Empty the beaker with the more concentrated solution. Repeat step 6 four more times, continuing down the table to
      pH 6, each time using the now-empty beaker to make a more dilute solution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7 with 1.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution in the corresponding beakers. Repeat them
      again for each of the two basic solutions, in their respective beakers, starting with 5.0 mL of the 1.0 M
      solutions made in step 3 and going from pH 13 to pH 8. Rinse the pipette and stir rod between different solutions
      to avoid cross-contamination.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rinse the conductivity probe with distilled water for storage, following manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. Empty
      and rinse the beakers, graduated cylinder, and pipette, being careful not to spill or touch the caustics. Return
      the chemicals to storage.

    These values are found by rather complicated means. For example, the pH 1 solution of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is
    created by adding 5.0 mL of 1.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to about 44 mL water. The pipette is precise to 0.1
    mL, so the uncertainty in the 5 mL measurement is &plusmn; 0.05 mL or &plusmn; 1%; the graduated cylinder is precise
    to 1 mL, so the uncertainty in the 44 mL measurement is &plusmn; 0.5 mL or about &plusmn; 1.1%. The formula to
    calculate the new concentration involves only multiplication and division (and also includes the concentration of
    the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, which is assumed to have no uncertainty), so we can add the percent
    uncertainties to conclude that the concentration of the new solution has an uncertainty of &plusmn; 2.1%. The
    &plusmn; 0.017 in table 3 is then created through a quadratic equation involving logarithms&mdash;the formula that
    relates concentration to pH. The other values, carrying on down the column, arise the same way, but the
    concentration of the previous solution is now relevant, so the uncertainty compounds (for simplicity, I have assumed
    that the addition each time is 2%, though in fact it fluctuates slightly). The same process applies to the other
    three columns, leading to the table above.

    Figure 1 shows the data in graphical form&mdash;orange for HCl, green for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, purple for
    NaOH, and black for Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Conductivity is projected logarithmically in order to display the
    data logically, but pH already accounts for its exponential nature. Note that the point at (7, 5.55) is shared by
    all four series. Figure 2 shows the best-fit curves for these data sets as determined by Desmos&rsquo;s logarithmic
    regression; on a linear-logarithmic plot, the exponential functions appear to have linear graphs.

    The question arises: what do these constants mean? Based on the nature of an exponential function, <em>a</em> is the
    value of <em>&sigma;</em> at the 0 point, which is 0 for the acids but 14 for the bases, and so must be in &mu;S/cm;
    <em>b</em> is the “slope,” the ratio by which <em>&sigma;</em> changes for every step h takes toward neutral 7, and
    is dimensionless. A min-max gradient analysis finds the uncertainties in this slope by measuring how far it could
    change while staying within the uncertainty boxes, producing the values in table 5.

    There is now a number to compare to external sources: according to one source, the conductivity of a solution is
    proportional to the square root of the concentration of ions, which would make the exponent 0.5.<a class="fn"
      id="ref-6" href="#fn-6">[6]</a> This means that the
    percent error in the experiment is between 20% and 36% for the different substances. Many sources, however, simply
    indicate that the exponent should be positive for acids and negative for bases, which is what the experiment found.
  </p>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    There is a straightforward answer to the research question: less neutral pH&mdash;further from 7&mdash;corresponds
    to greater conductivity, on an exponential scale. However, this does not account for any differences between acids
    and bases or between different sorts of these. The exponents on [H&#8314;] in table 6 imply that some species have a
    stronger correlation between pH and conductivity than others, with sodium hydroxide having the least and sodium
    carbonate having the most, but the uncertainty in these values means that no significant conclusions can be drawn in
    any direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    In theory, though, a distinction should exist: <em>ChemPRIME</em> provides that Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> should
    be slightly more conductive than NaOH, and HCl much more conductive than either base.<a class="fn" id="ref-7"
      href="#fn-7">[7]</a> (It does not give a value for
    H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but educated extrapolation would place it comparable to NaOH.) Therefore, there must
    have been something in the experiment that caused all the substances to appear indistinguishably similar. One aspect
    of this is random error, arising from limited precision with all measuring tools, such as the graduated cylinder and
    the conductivity probe; this shows up as uncertainty in data, which gets carried forward to all calculated values.
    The most effective way to reduce this would have been to run more trials and do steps 4, 5, and 6 of the procedure
    two or three times instead of just once. Then, data would be collected as average values, which will likely be more
    accurate and have more predictable uncertainty (rather than the complicated calculations for pH that I had to do).
    Random error could also be reduced with more precise equipment for certain measurements&mdash;for example, measuring
    quantities of distilled water to within 0.1 mL, instead of to 1 mL, as the graduated cylinder allows, and then just
    guessing at more precise amounts&mdash;although this could be limited by the precision of other equipment, such as
    the conductivity probe, of which my lab only has one kind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another possible source of the discrepancy is systematic error&mdash;forces that cause the results to be skewed in a
    particular direction overall. It would seem that this is present, given that the four percent errors are all in the
    same direction. One of these, for example, could be that, because I did not rinse the conductivity probe after every
    reading, it may have been contaminated with solution more concentrated than the one I was trying to measure at any
    given point. This would mean that the majority of my data points are slightly higher than they should have been, and
    the final exponents are also elevated. Systematic error could also have been induced by the entry of substances
    caked onto the beakers or in the tap water I used to rinse them out into the solutions I was measuring. This would
    almost certainly have introduced more ions into the solutions, meaning higher measured conductivity and thus higher
    values for the exponents in table 6. If both of these factors were corrected for, it might put those values within
    the range of uncertainty for the literature value. I could also have reduced these effects, potentially, by
    recognizing them before or during the experiment and acting accordingly&mdash;in these examples, by rinsing the
    conductivity probe between all trials, cleaning out the beakers carefully before starting, and using distilled water
    to rinse the beakers instead of tap water.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another major weakness of this investigation arises from the way I used pH. The values in table 1 were calculated
    based on only three sample points for each solution, which inevitably had some flaws: it is, in fact, possible to
    obtain a solution of sodium carbonate above pH 12, but the &ldquo;literature values&rdquo; implied the opposite. The
    complicated relationship between concentration of an acid or base and the pH of the solution meant that I struggled
    to determine it algebraically, not relying on extrapolation from a small sample size, but this led to my definition
    of pH being a measurement that is not exactly the actual pH. A simple way to improve this experiment might have been
    to utilize the pH probes that my lab has, which would eliminate these issues with pH values. I initially thought it
    would be easier to run the experiment if I could have a number to aim for without guessing-and-checking in the
    moment, but I do not think it made for a better investigation, though I cannot be sure exactly how much this
    impacted my results. Attempting to test four different substances in one experiment rather than just one may have
    also had a detrimental effect on this investigation, but I believe its largest impact was on time and not quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all the above shortcomings in this experiment, it appears to have been mostly successful on the whole. Despite
    some surprising data and quite large uncertainties for some values, the final numbers came quite close to their
    expected values, especially given the range of information that I was able to find as &ldquo;literature
    values.&rdquo; (I also do not believe that percent error does justice for exponents as opposed to dimensional
    quantities.) This investigation could be extended with similar research into other acids and bases and where they
    fit into the puzzle to attempt to more fully answer the initial question, as well as triprotic acids and bases in
    order to extend the pattern that is discovered. The effect of temperature on both pH and conductivity could also be
    explored to explain yet more aspects of this paradigm.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="noindent">
    Chemistry is a complex discipline. In seeking to explain all matter at a fundamental level, it constructs many
    principles for the workings of its systems, which have substantial overlap as they can describe the same systems in
    different ways. The pH scale is one way of thinking about the strength of a caustic solution, simplifying
    exponential growth to a linear scale that we can more easily comprehend. Considering the equilibrium reaction(s)
    occurring in such a solution provides another perspective on it, rooted more in the variety of species involved than
    the significance of one specifically. Conductivity is a property that can also describe such a system, approaching
    it from a viewpoint more linked to physics than the others are. With all of these ideas together, I can form a
    clearer picture of the true nature of the system and analyze it as I have in this paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, it is this multiplicity of paradigms that makes chemistry useful, and also that makes it difficult.
    Chemistry classes often divide the field into separate buckets&mdash;stoichiometry, redox, acids/bases, kinetics,
    and so on&mdash;because it is easier for students to learn one thing at a time, but inevitably parts of these show
    up in others in order to paint a reasonably complete picture of chemistry as a whole. Describing the discipline only
    by thinking about these divisions misses the nuances; its true nature can only be captured by always keeping the big
    picture in mind. This applies beyond chemistry as any pursuit can be viewed from many angles and at many levels.
    Missing the forest for the trees always means that something is going unnoticed, but it is easy to forget&mdash;or
    not to know&mdash;how big the forest really is. Only by taking a step back are we able to see all the good things in
    life.
