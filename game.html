  <h1 class="game">ma&#x028a;: a game</h1>
  <h3 class="game">The only rule I can tell you is that I can&rsquo;t tell you any other rules.</h3>

  <h2 class="game">Setup</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="materials">Materials.</span> The game requires a single deck of fifty-two standard playing
    cards and a table (or other surface) to play on.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="players">Players.</span> The game requires at least two players and is difficult with more
    than six with only one deck, but by combining multiple decks it can accommodate a (theoretically) unlimited number.
    Exactly one player is the dealer.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="deal">Deal.</span> The dealer deals a hand of five cards to each player and puts the
    remaining cards face-down in a draw pile in the center of the table.
  </p>

  <h2 class="game">Play</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="start">Start.</span> The dealer starts the game by flipping over the top card of the draw
    pile to form a face-up play pile and saying, &ldquo;The game of ma&#x028a; has now started.&rdquo; (For the purposes
    of all further rules, the game starts on the word &ldquo;ma&#x028a;.&rdquo;) Play starts to the left of the dealer
    and proceeds clockwise around the table.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="turn">Turn.</span> On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may draw a card from the top of the draw
    pile, and then they may play a card onto the play pile.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="penalties">Penalties.</span> The dealer assesses a penalty for a violation of a rule by
    giving the violating player the top card of the draw pile and naming the penalty.
  </p class="game">
  <ol class="game" type="a">
    <li id="penalties-a">
      A penalty consisting of a failure to perform a specific action or of performing it incorrectly does not need to be
      rectified; multiple penalties cannot be assessed for one such failure.
    </li>
    <li id="penalties-b">
      The dealer must allow a player a reasonable amount of time to perform an action before penalizing them for its
      failure.
    </li>
    <li id="penalties-c">
      An action by a player that is clearly prompted by the dealer moving to assess the penalty for failing to do it is
      ignored and the penalty assessed as if the action had not occurred.
    </li>
    <li id="penalties-d">
      A penalty regarding play rules or an action caused by a play may not be assessed once another turn has been played
      after the illegal behavior unless there was not a reasonable amount of time to assess the penalty.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="pauses">Pauses.</span> The game may be paused by any player by saying, &ldquo;Point of
    order.&rdquo; If this player is not the dealer, the dealer must say, &ldquo;Sustained,&rdquo; to pause the game, or
    &ldquo;Overruled,&rdquo; to continue the game without pausing (this power to prevent a pause should be used
    sparingly). While the game is paused, turns are not played, but penalties may be assessed. The game resumes
    following a pause when the dealer says, &ldquo;Meeting adjourned.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="shuffling">Shuffling.</span> If the draw pile runs out of cards, the dealer (or another
    player) replaces the play pile with only its top card, shuffles the rest, and places them facedown to create the new
    draw pile. The game may be paused for this to occur, but it is not necessary.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="end">End.</span> The game ends when a player has no cards remaining in their hand and has
    earned no penalties; that player wins. At this point, the winning player or the dealer says, &ldquo;The game of
    ma&#x028a; has now ended.&rdquo;
  </p>

  <h2 class="game">Base rules</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="playcards">Playing cards.</span> A card can be played onto the play pile that is the same
    suit or the same value as the one below it. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;improper play&rdquo; (the
    illegally-played card remains on the play pile).
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="last">Last card.</span> when the number of cards in a player&rsquo;s hand becomes one, they
    must say &ldquo;ma&#x028a;.&rdquo; A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;failure to say
    &lsquo;ma&#x028a;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="talking">Talking.</span> players may not speak except as required by the rules (for game
    actions, giving penalties, etc.) or while the game is paused. The dealer has discretion of when it is unreasonable
    to enforce this penalty (e.g., for talking to someone outside the game). A violation of this rule is assessed
    &ldquo;talking.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="out">Out of turn.</span> A player may not play onto the play pile or draw from the draw pile
    when it is another player&rsquo;s turn. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;not your turn.&rdquo; Any
    illegally-played cards are returned to the hand of the player who played them, and illegally-drawn cards are
    retained in the player&rsquo;s hand.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="delay">Delay of game.</span> A player must play within a reasonable amount of time
    (approximately five seconds, depending on the situation) after it becomes their turn or after the previous
    assessment of this penalty. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;delay of game&rdquo; or &ldquo;your turn,
    go.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="pointing">Pointing.</span> A player may not indicate in any obvious manner to the player
    whose turn it is that it is their turn. This rule may be suspended by the dealer as long as it does not impact the
    game (e.g., if no rules in play change the turn order at any point). A violation of this rule is assessed
    &ldquo;pointing&rdquo; or &ldquo;gesturing.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="discussion">Discussion of rules.</span> Players may not discuss or explain the rules of the
    game except <a class="rule" href="#deal">Deal</a>, <a class="rule" href="#turn">Turn</a>,
    <a class="rule" href="#end">End</a>, and this rule. This rule applies before the game begins and between
    games&mdash;which may result in extra cards being dealt to a player in the <a class="rule" href="#deal">
      Deal
    </a>&mdash;and while the game is paused. Rules may be referenced, if needed, by the penalty assessed or the
    <span class="rule">names</span> at the beginning of the paragraphs here, but anything that would reveal a detail of
    the rule to an unaware player is a violation of this rule. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;discussion of
    the rules.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="corrections">Corrections.</span> A player who is not the dealer may assess a penalty,
    believing that the dealer failed to assess it. If there was no violation or it was different than as assessed, the
    card is given instead to the original assessor as the penalty &ldquo;bad call.&rdquo; A dispute over this may lead
    to an assessment of &ldquo;good call,&rdquo; giving the card to the violator, or of &ldquo;no call,&rdquo; returning
    the card to the top of the draw pile. (If there was a violation but the original assessor failed to name the
    penalty, the dealer names the penalty represented by the card that was given.) Regardless of the outcome of any
    correction call, it is the dealer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that all actual penalties are correctly assessed.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="discretion">Discretion.</span> The dealer always reserves the right to address unforeseen,
    game-breaking behavior in an appropriate manner. This may include assessing penalties not explicitly defined to
    signal that a given behavior is not part of the game or removing a player who clearly is not taking the game
    seriously. By the same token, the dealer reserves the right not to assess a penalty when a behavior that technically
    warrants one clearly does not fall under the intent of the relevant rule; however, it is imperative that the dealer
    enforce the rules as given so players are able to learn them.
  </p>

  <h2 class="game">Standard rules</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="touching">Touching cards.</span> A player who is not the dealer may not touch their cards
    prior to the start of the game (as given in <a class="rule" href="#start">Start</a>) or while the game is paused
    (given a reasonable amount of time after the pause is called). This rule is notably not covered by
    <a class="rule" href="#penalties-a">Penalties (a)</a>; a player who violates this rule must also correct the
    behavior to avoid being penalized again. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;touching your cards.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="playextension">Play extension.</span> In addition to the legal plays given by the
    <a class="rule" href="#playcards">Playing cards</a> rule, a card can be played that is the same color as the one
    below it and one higher or one lower in value.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="knocking1">Knocking.</span> When a player plays a Hearts card, they must knock twice on the
    table. Failure to do so is assessed &ldquo;failure to knock twice,&rdquo; and knocking at any other time or knocking
    the wrong number of times is assessed &ldquo;improper knocking.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="ailments">Ailments.</span> When a player plays a face card (J, Q, K), they must say,
    &ldquo;All hail the {name} of {suit},&rdquo; where {name} is &ldquo;jack,&rdquo; &ldquo;queen,&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;king&rdquo; for J, Q, and K, respectively, and {suit} is &ldquo;knaves,&rdquo; &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;clovers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hearts&rdquo; for Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, and Hearts, respectively, according to
    the identity of the card played. A player who says &ldquo;13 points&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;All hail the queen of
    knaves&rdquo; is not in violation of this rule. Any violation of this rule upon playing a face card is assessed
    &ldquo;improper ailment of the {name} of {suit},&rdquo; with the same substitutions as above for the card that was
    played, and saying this at any other time is assessed &ldquo;talking&rdquo; under the
    <a class="rule" href="#talking">Talking</a> rule.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="subway">Subway.</span> When a player plays a card that is the same value as the card two
    cards below it in the play pile, they must say, &ldquo;Subway.&rdquo; Failure to do so at the appropriate time is
    assessed &ldquo;failure to say subway,&rdquo; and saying this at any other time is assessed &ldquo;talking&rdquo;
    under the <a class="rule" href="#talking">Talking</a> rule.
  </p>

  <h2 class="game">Additional rules</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="order">Turn order.</span> When a 10 is played, the next player&rsquo;s turn is skipped, and
    play continues with the following player. When an A is played, the direction of play reverses, and play continues
    with the player who was just skipped, if such a player exists, and the player who just played otherwise. If a 10 is
    flipped as the starting card at the <a class="rule" href="#start">Start</a>, play instead starts two players to the
    left of the dealer; if the starting card is an A, play starts to the right of the dealer and continues
    counter-clockwise. Penalties are not assessed for this rule, but it often leads to penalties under
    <a class="rule" href="#out">Out of turn</a> and <a class="rule" href="#delay">Delay of game</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="knocking2">Knocking (part 2).</span> When a player plays a card that is a different suit from
    the one below it, they must knock once. Failure to do so is assessed &ldquo;failure to knock once,&rdquo; and
    knocking at any other time or knocking the wrong number of times is assessed &ldquo;improper knocking.&rdquo; (When
    this rule and the above <a class="rule" href="#knocking1">Knocking</a> rule are in play, a player may be required to
    knock zero, one, two, or three times on a turn. The assessment of &ldquo;improper knocking&rdquo; must account for
    both rules when determining &ldquo;the wrong number of times&rdquo; to knock. Note also that it is possible for a
    player to be penalized for both &ldquo;failure to knock once&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure to knock twice&rdquo; in the
    same turn.)
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="bandaid">Band-Aid.</span> A player may not hold the cards in their hand such that other
    players can see them. This rule is not covered by <a class="rule" href="#penalties-a">Penalties (a)</a>, so a player
    must rectify the violation to avoid being penalized multiple times. It also generally disregards
    <a class="rule" href="#corrections">Corrections</a>; any player may assess this penalty against any other player, in
    light of the fact that the dealer will not be able to identify all possible violations, and the dealer should not
    challenge such assessments until and unless it is clear that they are being made in bad faith or are disrupting the
    game. A violation of this rule is assessed &ldquo;Band-Aid.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="christmas">Merry Christmas.</span> When a player draws a card as part of their turn, the next
    player in the turn order must say, &ldquo;Merry Christmas.&rdquo; (When this rule and the
    <a class="rule" href="#order">Turn order</a> rule are in play, any turn order change as a result of that rule is
    ignored for the purpose of this rule.) Failure to do so is assessed &ldquo;failure to say Merry Christmas,&rdquo;
    and saying this at any other time is assessed &ldquo;talking&rdquo; under the
    <a class="rule" href="#talking">Talking</a> rule.
  </p>

  <h2 class="game">Variations</h2>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="set">Rule set.</span> The standard version of the game includes all the base rules and
    standard rules, with the additional rules being added over time to make the game more interesting. Other rule sets
    may be used; they must include all the base rules and then may incorporate any combination of other rules, including
    ones not defined here. The original rule set for this game uses the
    <a class="rule" href="#extension">Play extension</a>, <a class="rule" href="#knocking">Knocking</a>,
    <a class="rule" href="#ailments">Ailments</a>, <a class="rule" href="#subway">Subway</a>, and
    <a class="rule" href="#bandaid">Band-Aid</a> rules, with the following modifications:
  </p>
  <ol class="game" type="a">
    <li>
      No exception is made in the <a class="rule" href="#discussion">Discussion of rules</a> rule.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of the procedure in <a class="rule" href="#pauses">Pauses</a>, the game is paused with the game is paused
      with &ldquo;The game of ma&#x028a; is now paused,&rdquo; and resumed with &ldquo;The game of ma&#x028a; has now
      started,&rdquo; said by any player.
    </li>
    <li>
      The &ldquo;13 points&rdquo; variation in the <a class="rule" href="#ailments">Ailments</a> rule is not allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of the procedure in <a class="rule" href="#corrections">Corrections</a>, a player who notices a missed
      penalty from the dealer, once another turn has been played due to <a class="rule" href="#penalties-d">
        Penalties (d)
      </a>, assesses the dealer &ldquo;failure to say&rdquo; followed by the penalty that should have been assessed.
      (This does mean that the original illegal behavior goes unpenalized.) There is no established procedure for
      countering an incorrect penalty given this way, so disputes could be settled by pausing the game and discussing
      (keeping in mind the <a class="rule" href="#discussion">Discussion of rules</a> rule).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="game">
    <span class="rule" id="extension">Extension.</span> The standard game is, in essence, a puzzle, testing new players
    to learn the game without being told the rules. To make the game more game-like for experienced players, extend the
    exception in the <a class="rule" href="#discussion">Discussion of rules</a> rule to all the base rules and the setup
    and play instructions. Then, after each game, the winner of the game becomes the dealer for the next game and
    creates a rule that is in play from that point forward or modifies or removes an existing rule (usually they must
    tell another player what the new rule or rule change is to prevent cheating). In this variation, the standard and
    additional rules may be added over time or used as inspiration to come up with other rules, or they may be ignored
    entirely.
